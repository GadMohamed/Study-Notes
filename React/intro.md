# Intro.

1. What makes React SPECIAL?: 
  - its compositional model. (composition: combining simple functions together to create complex functions.)/ ( A good function should follow the "DOT" rule)
  - its declarative nature.(Not imperative) (you tell JS what you want to do and it takes care of the steps to do it itself).
  - the way data flows through a component.(unidirectional data flow => from parent to children and also data update occurs only in parent component).(Not 2 way data binding).
  - it is just JavaScript.
